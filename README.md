Test-Driven Development (TDD) was applied as follows:



Write a Test (e.g., testCheckWin, testReset, testDraw): The development process began by defining the expected behavior of the TicTacToe class through tests. Each test represented a specific functionality, such as checking for a win, testing the reset functionality, and ensuring the correct behavior in a draw scenario.


Run the Test: Initially, when these tests were executed, they failed because the corresponding functionality did not exist in the TicTacToe class or was not implemented correctly.


Write the Code (in TicTacToe class): Following the failing tests, the development process involved writing the necessary code in the TicTacToe class to make the tests pass. Methods like makeMove, checkWin, reset, and isBoardFull were implemented to fulfill the specified requirements.


Run the Test Again: After writing the code, the tests were rerun to verify that the new implementations met the expected behavior. Passing the tests indicated that the TicTacToe class now satisfied the defined requirements.
